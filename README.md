Predict RNA unwinding behavior using sequence + structure features and machine learning

This project builds a supervised machine learning model to predict whether a helicase can efficiently unwind an RNA sequence based on:

- GC content
- Stem-loop count
- AU-rich motif presence
- Sequence length

Purpose - Demonstrate how sequence + structure features can predict helicase–RNA interaction behavior — useful for RNA design.
